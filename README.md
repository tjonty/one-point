## What’s This All About? 🚀  
Say goodbye to scattered links and hello to *ONE-POINT*—a minimalist, SvelteKit-powered app that puts all your professional links in one sleek spotlight. Log in with Firebase Authentication, craft your custom page, and let your audience find everything they need in a single click. Built for simplicity, speed, and style.

### Why It’s Cool 😎  
- **One-Page Magic**: All your links, one stunning view.  
- **Firebase Auth**: Secure logins with zero hassle.  
- **SvelteKit Vibes**: Reactive, fast, and oh-so-smooth.  
- **Tailwind + DaisyUI**: Clean design that *pops*.  
- **Editable Profiles**: Your space, your rules—update anytime.  

## What I’ve Mastered 🛠️  
Building *ONE-POINT* leveled up my skills:  
- SvelteKit’s routing and SSR wizardry.  
- Firebase for auth and data—scalable and snappy.  
- TailwindCSS + DaisyUI for pixel-perfect, responsive layouts(let me know if I missed something).  
- Stores in Svelte to keep user data flowing seamlessly.  
- Vite’s lightning-fast dev experience.

## Live and Thriving 🌍
This isn’t a prototype—it’s a polished, live app ready to roll. Deployed on Netlify, it’s serving up link perfection right now. What’s next?
- Custom profile themes (because style matters).
- Link click analytics (know your audience).
- Social previews that steal the show.
 
## Built With 🔥  
- **SvelteKit**: The backbone of it all.  
- **Firebase**: Auth and hosting, sorted.  
- **TailwindCSS + DaisyUI**: Style without the sweat.
